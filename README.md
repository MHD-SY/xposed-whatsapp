xposed-whatsapp
===========

Utilising the [Xposed framework](http://repo.xposed.info/module/de.robv.android.xposed.installer), this module adds tweaks to make WhatsApp more useful to me. Currently includes:

- [Removal of the voice and/or camera buttons](#removal-of-the-camera-andor-voice-buttons) from the conversation view
- The ability to [keep the contact list](#keep-contact-list-in-the-history) (called "New Chat" in WhatsApp) in your history, so when you launch a conversation using it and then press the back button, it doesn't skip straight back to the main conversations list.
- [Highlight groups](#highlight-groups) in the conversations list

Removal of the camera and/or voice buttons
------------------------------------------

Some time ago, WhatsApp added the "audio voice" feature. I found it hindered significantly more than it helped: if you tapped it accidentally, it would vibrate and emit a notification-like sound. And, I would do this repeatedly and so never found this useful (I don't use voice messaging).

More time passes, and they add a camera icon. This is more useful, and personally I'd prefer if that was the only one. So - I wrote this.

(*Note:* in all cases, the "send message" button will appear after you start typing, as it always would. Additionally, disabling sending still allows you to receive them.)

I have tested it on my HTC One M7, using Android Revolution HD, but I have no reason to suspect it shouldn't work on other devices.

Keep contact list in the history
--------------------------------

When navigating to a conversation via the "contact list" (main WhatsApp screen > "New Chat" on the action bar > Select a contact) and you press the back key, rather than returning to the contact list, it returns you back to the main WhatsApp screen with your list of conversations - which can be a little frustrating.

This mod allows you to "go back" to the contact list, so you can chat uninterrupted.

Highlight Groups
----------------

It isn't always easy to see at a glance which of your conversations are groups, and which are which other people. This mod allows you to highlight the group conversations in any colour of your choice.
